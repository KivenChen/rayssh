## Debugging This Project

**IMPORTANT**: To properly debug this project, you MUST first establish a remote terminal connection using:

```bash
rayssh .
```

This command will:
- Connect you to a Ray worker node
- Upload the current directory to the remote environment  
- Give you a working terminal on the remote cluster
- Allow you to run and debug code in the actual Ray environment

## Why This Matters

This project uses Ray for distributed computing. Simply running code locally won't work because:
- Ray actors and tasks need to run on the cluster
- Dependencies and environment setup happen on remote nodes
- File paths and working directories are different in the cluster context

## Debugging Workflow

1. **First, always run**: `rayssh .`
2. **Then you can**: 
   - Run Python scripts: `python your_script.py`
   - Check Ray status: `ray status`
   - Debug interactively: `python -i your_script.py`
   - Install packages: `pip install package_name`
   - Edit files: `vim/nano file.py`

## Other Useful RaySSH Commands

- `rayssh --ls` - List available nodes
- `rayssh lab` - Launch Jupyter Lab on remote
- `rayssh code` - Launch VS Code server on remote
- `rayssh -l` - Interactive node selection

## Remember

üéØ **Always start with `rayssh .` before attempting to debug!**

Without this, you'll be debugging in the wrong environment and things won't work as expected.
